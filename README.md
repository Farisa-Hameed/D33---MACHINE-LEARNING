# D33---MACHINE-LEARNING
This assignment involved predicting car prices using various regression models. After preprocessing the data, we implemented five models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor. We evaluated their performance, identified key features, and fine-tuned the best model for improved accuracy.
